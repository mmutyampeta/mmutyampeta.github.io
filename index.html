        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Mihir Mutyampeta, and I am a sophomore at Purdue University, pursuing a dual major in
            Computer
            Science and Data Science, as well as a dual minor in Mathematics and Business Economics. <br>
            On campus, I am involved in the Data Mine, as a Teaching Assistant in the Corporate Partners program. This
            involves leading a team of 10, working on a data science project for Minecraft, with a mentor for the team,
            who is a full-time professional at Minecraft. <br>
            In my past experience as an Automation Specialist at Correlation One, I spearheaded automation efforts, to
            streamline and standardize heavy manual tasks of the Operations team, through Python scripts and API
            integrations.<br><br>
